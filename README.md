# Personal notes

This is collection of personal notes. You can have look around and
find something that might peak your interest.

### Why not use notion ?
I do use notion but for more personal stuff. Plus I can check these notes from 
anywhere. Sure They are not that good looking but they work pretty fine cause 
when I am learning stuff I tend to be in my editor and thus this the best solution
I came up with. 


### TODOS
- [ ] Site to see these notes better.
- [ ] Automate in someway


# Misc 

I didn't where to put these still figuring out :

windows : You can type "." in run prompt to open explorer in user directory
