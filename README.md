# Personal notes

This is collection of personal notes. You can have look around and
find something that might peak your interest.

### Why not use notion ?

I do use notion but for more personal stuff. Plus I can check these notes from
anywhere. Sure They are not that good looking but they work pretty fine cause
when I am learning stuff I tend to be in my editor and thus this the best solution
I came up with.

### TODOS

-   [ ] Site to see these notes better.
-   [ ] Automate in someway

# Projects That I want to work on for fun
