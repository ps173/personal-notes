# Data Buffers

### Short notes

- a **data buffer (or just buffer) is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data** while it is being moved from one place to another.
- Typically, the data is stored in a buffer as it is retrieved from an input device or just before it is sent to an output device.
- However, a buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer.
- **When are they used ?**

    Buffers are typically used when there is a **difference between the rate at which data is received and the rate at which it can be processed** for example in online video streaming.
