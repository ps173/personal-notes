# Basics of any backend framework

I started with express.js for backend framework. There are others like django, flask, laravel, rails and lot more. I used javascript mostly thus opted for express as a the backend framework

Express has this basic jargon about things that it does

- Routes  : This is general term for various "paths" that will be present in your application/ server. for example `[myapp.com/route1/](http://myapp.com/route1/:someinfo)` .
- Middlewares : A middleware is just a set of instruction that are are executed during the lifecycle of a request to server.  Some popular middlewares are :
    - Helmet : It secures your app by setting various http headers. See [https://helmetjs.github.io/](https://helmetjs.github.io/)
    - Morgan : It is tiny logger for your server.
    - Cors : provides cross-origin-customization in your express app. see

    [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - HTTP | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

 

- API : Application Programming Interface is a type of software interface that provides connection between programs or computers. We often make a api to hydrate front end with data from database.
