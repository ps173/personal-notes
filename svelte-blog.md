# Trying Out Svelte For First Time

So I have been wanting to re-create my personal [website](ps173.github.io) (another blog on this soon).
I really like development with next-js. But there's a lot of lot of dependencies 
which makes it quite a huge app. And I think that a personal website 
should be as fast as possible. So why not choose something like vanilla html.
Well Yea html will work totally fine. But I wanted to try something new.
I choose svelte as a the other framework. I wanted to try it for the longest
time. And thus I choose svelte.

I like lot of stuff about svelte. The idea of keeping things less complex is
very likeable. If I would have tried using svelte right after learning js,
I think it would be easier than getting used to react. Here's my opinion or more
of a description of svelte. I might be wrong about something so pardon me there as
I have spent less than a week with svelte.

Also Since I have made the intro this long. I might just say that I don't really want to hate on other
framework. I think this [opinionism](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=opinionism) is bad 
I just want to keep this a healthy overview of svelte.

# About Svelte 

Svelte is a UI framework. Unlike react and friends (or should I say enemies), 
svelte does not use any virtual DOM. Rather it compiles your code to tiny framework less vanilla js.
This makes the app really fast. Also Svelte does not have any complex state management.
I learnt most of the stuff about svelte from [svelte-tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics)

# Components in Svelte 

So let's start with what I think the makes all the frameworks worth using,
Components. I think making your UI into little components makes UI really easy
to manage and program. I am not a frontend guy honestly but I like the fact that 
I can have multiple elements divided in my UI. Again this post is not on why 
frontend frameworks are good. 

In svelte the components are files with .svelte extension. Not a great change
that's just another syntax ( also btw why do all these frameworks create their
own custom syntax).  But wait you don't have to export the components here. 
Suppose you have this parent called `App.svelte`.

```svelte
<!--Lets' call this component App.svelte and yes this is a html comment-->
<script>
// here is js comment :)
 import MyComponent from "path-to-component/MyComponent.svelte"
</script>

<MyComponent />
```

and here's `MyComponent.svelte`: 

```svelte
<!--- MyComponent.svelte --->
<p>
This is my component
</p>
```

# Props in Svelte 

You thought that svelte does not have props.  Svelte has export statements to 
export props or as I like to say 'recognize props' (Not a proper term don't use it).

This is a child component let's call it `Weatherdetails.svelte`

```svelte 
<!--- Weatherdetails.svelte --->
<script>
	export let answer;
</script>

<p>The weather is {answer}</p>
```

Let's call the parent component `App.svelte`.

```svelte
<script>
	import Weatherdetails from './Weatherdetails.svelte';
</script>

<Weatherdetails answer="humid :\"/>
```

I like how svelte devs explain how this in not javascript-ish.

I am hoping to see it become second nature :)

# Reactivity in Svelte

Again as svelte describes it does not uses any complex state management.
According to the svelte website "At heart of svelte is a powerful system of
reactivity". This means that you can call javascript inside your html (not
literally I just like to think of it this way). Here's the reactivity explained
in the good ol' counter app.

```svelte
<script>
let counter = 0
function increaseCount(){
  count += 1
}
</script>

<h1> Current Count : {count} </h1>
<button on:click={increaseCount}> 
    click to increase count ! 
</button>
```
Wow that was quick.

Here you can see it's like react state just has a lot less boiler-plate.
Also svelte introduces a special thing which is somewhat similar to `useEffect` 
hook in react.

```svelte
<script>
let counter = 0
function increaseCount(){
  count += 1
}
$: square = count * count
</script>

<h1> Current Count : {count} </h1>
<button on:click={increaseCount}> 
    click to increase count ! 
</button>
<p>The square of {count} is {square} </p>
```
**Here the `$` looks a little weird. But this basically tells svelte compiler
that whenever any of referenced value statement changes do this thing.** 

# Conditional rendering and Await in markup 

To render text conditionally svelte applies a little bit custom markup syntax. 

```svelte
<script>
	let user = { loggedIn: false };

	function toggle() {
		user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
	}
</script>

{#if user.loggedIn}
	<button on:click={toggle}>
		Log out
	</button>
{:else}
	<button on:click={toggle}>
		Log in
	</button>
{/if}
```

So here according to svelte website again 
>A # character always indicates a block opening tag. 
>A / character always indicates a block closing tag. 
>A : character, as in {:else}, indicates a block continuation tag. 
>Don't worry ‚Äî you've already learned almost all the syntax Svelte adds to HTML.

Now this the normal part. Jinja follows same pattern. But wait we have more.
Introducing the asynchronous await in markup. Wanna see how this looks. Here

```svelte
<script>
	async function getCatImage() {
		const res = await fetch("https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search");
		const jsonres = await res.json();
		const imageUrl = await jsonres[0].url

		if (res.ok) {
			return imageUrl;
		} else {
			throw new Error("No image found or something went wrong");
		}
	}

	let promise = getCatImage();

	function handleClick() {
		promise = getCatImage();
	}
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
A random cat üêà
</button>

<!-- Awaitting the response -->
{#await promise}
	<p>...waiting</p>
{:then src}
	<img {src} alt="a cat"/>
{:catch error}
	<p style="color: red">{error.message}</p>
{/await}
```
this code gives you a random cat image. I was really impressed when I first saw this.

Here's the working demo üêà‚ú®

# Binding the state

Do you guys remember the old class based components in react where you had to bind the 
function to specific component. Svelte does something similar but more simpler looking.

```svelte
<script>
	let name = 'world';
</script>
<input bind:value={name}>
```

this will change the value of name with input provided. The bind-action (in this case value) 
may change from element to element. The one that applies to all is `this`.
This something like `useRef` hook from react. It provides you a reference to a rendered element.

For example you can do something like this :
```svelte
<script>
	let canvas;

 onMount(()=>{
  let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d")
  ctx.
 })
</script>


<canvas 
 bind:this = {canvas}
></canvas>

<style>
	canvas {
		width: 100%;
		height: 100%;
		background-color: #666;
		-webkit-mask: url(svelte-logo-mask.svg) 50% 50% no-repeat;
		mask: url(svelte-logo-mask.svg) 50% 50% no-repeat;
	}
</style>

```
