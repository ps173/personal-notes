# Exploring Web Components 

# Wild Intro AKA State of web
Well I have been hearing a lot of "web has been exploited by the bloat of 
javascript frameworks", or that web is not easy to work with any more and we 
need to change the way build websites and go back to plain and traditional html
and css. In a recent [video by Rich Harris](https://youtu.be/860d8usGC0o) ( a great talk by the way please 
check it out) he mentions a new way to build the web apps which he quotes 
"transitional webapps" which he believes will become a new approach to web development 
in possible future. Also many people say that web technologies are fine
and the state [package management is a hot mess](https://nadh.in/blog/javascript-ecosystem-software-development-are-a-hot-mess/) which certainly correct.

All of this aside we still need to create and serve user experience (UX)
without making our html hard to understand and read and also keeping the
components interactive. Cool. That's the reason we have javascript. Is it right
to keep html in javascript or is it right to have a template that we can use to
generate html? IDK. I will leave that on the other [elders](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Technological%20Boomer) to decide. I will
continue exploring until I have seen enough and I am one of those boomers.

Nonetheless the weird and wild intro aside, everything above was just to get you 
engaged and now since you all are engaged, So I am gonna chatter about web components. 

# The Real Web Components

Firstly I may define which web components are we talking about. I am not talking 
about the components that we use in react or angular or svelte. I am talking about the
REAL Web Components.
So in [some blog](https://viljamis.com/2019/why-we-use-web-components/) I read a definition which I think defines these web components in most poetic way.

>  We had the urge to create a tech-agnostic instead of tech-specific system. A system that is based on web standards and would survive the births and deaths of JavaScript frameworks.
